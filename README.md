# Protein_molecules

The purpose of this project is to make comparison between protein molecules. In this algorithm 
it is used secondary structures for making complete weight undirected graph. The information for 
protein molecules is from pdb (Protein Data Bank) files. The nodes in the graph are alpha spirals 
and plains of beta folded sheet.

In the application also have opportunity to see 3D models of a proteins but it is needed to have
jmol binary files (https://github.com/BobHanson/Jmol-SwingJS/tree/master). You can use script.bat 
file which has to be in directory with jmol application.

This kind of algorithms are used for classifying proteins in different groups. The proteins in 
same group have same properties. It is useful also for understanding same diseases better and 
finding new cures.
